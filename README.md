# Unsupervised-Domain-Aligment
Development of a Deep Neural Network to classify pictures of real life objects using images from product advertising and viceversa, using the Adaptiope dataset. 

This code was created during a group project for the course Deep Learning, academic year 2021/2022.

The code was written on Google Colab, and therefore requires to be run on this site. A requirement to be run succesfully is to have the [Adaptiope dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FmdsvetC0oVyrFJ9ER7fcN-cXPOWx2gq/view?usp=sharing) in the Drive directory.
